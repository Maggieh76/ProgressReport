Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
I have created the backdrop visuals of my game (the hangman stand and title) and begun creating the code for the letter guessing portion of the game. I also was able to find a dictionary file with Prof Rosen which will help me further my code.
TODO

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I have to make it so my code randomizes a word from the file and then creates empty blank tiles for each letter in the word. I then have to create the hangman pieces and have them show up when a guess is incorrect and have the letters show up when they are correct. I also may add sound effects and a "previosuly guessed" box
TODO

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
my main problem has been figuring out if I want to do all of my code in main.lua or if I should create different files for each function. I am hoping getting the words into the game won't be too hard since that is the main portion of the game.I also have to learn how to have rectangles and shapes that hide until something happens.
